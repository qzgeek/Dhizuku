# Sorry

I am very sorry that there is no English translation for the time being because the English of the editor is really poor.

I will try to use a translator to translate this article in the future, but it will not be finished for a short time.

If you need to read this article, it is recommended to open the [Tap To Translate Screen](https://liteapks.com/tap-to-translate-screen.html)

Understand Hooray!
